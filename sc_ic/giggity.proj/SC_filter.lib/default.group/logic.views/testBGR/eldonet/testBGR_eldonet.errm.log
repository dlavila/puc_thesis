Warning: (eldo - 1619) This netlist contains expressions using strongly non-linear functions such as ABS() MIN(), 
+   MAX() (found in device X_BGR1.XR6.R1 for instance) 
+   If, and only if, convergence problems occur either in DC or transient analysis, 
+   the .option mmsmooth is a possible workaround worth testing. 
+   It is NOT recommended to activate it systematically, or if there are no particular convergence problems. 
+   Please refer to the documentation for further discussions about this option
