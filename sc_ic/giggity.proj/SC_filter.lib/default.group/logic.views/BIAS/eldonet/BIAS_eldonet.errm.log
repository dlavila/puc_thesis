+   If, and only if, convergence problems occur either in DC or transient analysis, 
+   the .option mmsmooth is a possible workaround worth testing. 
+   It is NOT recommended to activate it systematically, or if there are no particular convergence problems. 
+   Please refer to the documentation for further discussions about this option
