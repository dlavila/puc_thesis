\section{Summary}

This thesis deals with the use of discrete-time filters to lower the noise present in particle physics detectors front-end circuits. The main contributions of this work are: the development of a new mathematical framework for a design-oriented analysis of discrete-time filters in the discrete-time domain; and the design and implementation of a switched-capacitor filter for arbitrary weighting function synthesis to be included in the Bean V2 IC.

The noise analysis methodology introduced in this work allows to easily compute the optimal discrete-time filter that maximizes the SNR of a typical detector front-end circuit, a difficult task to undertake using the traditional methods for continuous-time networks.

The SC filter for arbitrary weighting function synthesis for the Bean 2 IC has been also presented, along with post-layout simulations for functionality verification. The use of this filter,  along with a proper characterization of the CSA and detector noise statistics, will allow to design an optimum filter based on the noise analysis presented in this work.
